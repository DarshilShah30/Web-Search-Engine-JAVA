# Web-Search-Engine-JAVA
Search engines are web-based software programs that help you find the information you are looking for online using keywords and phrases. Search engines can continuously crawl the Internet and index every page found so that results can be returned quickly, even if there are millions of websites online. 
When the user enters a search term, the search engine looks up the page title, content, and keywords of the indexed website and uses an algorithm (step-by-step) to create a list of websites. At the top of the list are the most relevant searches.

This is the workflow of this project.
